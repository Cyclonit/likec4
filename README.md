## What is C4 Model and Architecture-as-a-code?

The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about C4 - check the website, you get the idea very quickly.

### Architecture-as-a-code

Architecture-as-a-Code is an approach thar promotes treating architecture artifacts such as diagrams as a code.  
It encourages capturing architectural design decisions, components, relationships, and constraints in code files, which can be version-controlled.

With automation, the system documentation and architecture diagrams are generated, validated and integrated into the software development lifecycle.


## Why "LikeC4"?

[C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is great, thanks [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/).  
But sometimes we want to go beyond four layers, have custom ones with our semantics.
