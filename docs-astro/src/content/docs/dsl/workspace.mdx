Workspace is a directory with LikeC4 source files.  
When parsed, these files are "_merged_" into a single architecture model.  
You are free to organize the workspace as you want.


### Example

Assume we have the following workspace:

<FileTree>
- cloud
  - service1.c4
  - service2.c4
- externals
  - amazon.c4
- landscape.c4
- specs.c4
</FileTree>


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="specs.c4">
    This file defines the specification:

    ```likec4
    // specs.c4
    specification {
      element actor {
        style {
          shape person
        }
      }
      element system
      element service
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="landscape.c4">
    This file defines the top-level elements and landscape view:

    ```likec4
    // landscape.c4
    model {
      customer = actor 'Customer'
      cloud = system 'Cloud System'
    }
    views {
      view index of cloud {
        title "Cloud System - Landscape"
        include *
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="externals/amazon.c4">
    We keep definitions of external systems separate, inside the `externals/` folder:
    
    ```likec4
    // externals/amazon.c4
    model {
      amazon = system 'Amazon Web Services' {
        rds = service 'Database'
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Extend element

`extend` is a way to enrich the model and define nested elements in a separate file.

For instance, we don't want to mess up the _landscape.c4_ file with the internals of the `cloud`.  
In a separate _cloud/service1.c4_ file we define `cloud.service1`:

```likec4
// cloud/service1.c4
model {
  // cloud is defined in landscape.c4
  extend cloud {
    // here we define cloud.service1
    service1 = service 'Service 1'
  }
}
```

The element extension inherits the scope of the target (or better say _**parent**_).  
For example, _cloud/service2.c4_ file:

```likec4
// cloud/service2.c4
model {
  // cloud is defined in landscape.c4
  extend cloud {
    // define cloud.service2
    service2 = service 'Some Service 2' {

      -> service1 'delegates some work' // ✅ service1 is known inside 'cloud', 
                                        //    and resolved even defined in another file 
    }
  }

  // service2 unique inside the file
  service2 -> service1       // ⛔️ Error: service1 not found
                             //    as can't be resolved from this file

  service2 -> cloud.service1 // ✅ OK: Resolved by fully qualified name
}
```

<Aside type='caution'>
Extended element must be referenced by a fully qualified name.  
</Aside>

Example:

```likec4
model {
  extend rds        // ⛔️ Error: rds not found in the global scope
  extend amazon.rds // ✅ Resolved by fully qualified name
}
```
