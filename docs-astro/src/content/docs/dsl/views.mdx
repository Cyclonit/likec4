Views are the architecture diagrams, projections of the model from different perspectives, with different levels of details, like:

- System / service overviews
- Components interactions in specific use case
- Data flows and sequence diagrams

### View definition

Views are defined in `views` section.  
Views may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced):

```likec4
views {
  // with name
  view index {
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

View's name is used as a filename during the export, and a URL part for the sharing, so better to define it.

<Aside>
  `index` is a special view, and is rendered by default if no view name is specified.  
  If not defined, it will be generated for top-level elements
</Aside>

Views may have a title, description, tags and links (same as [model element](../model#element)):

```likec4
views {

  view epic12 {
    #next, #epic-12
    title "Cloud System - Changes in Epic-12"
    description "
      This diagram shows the high-level
      components and interactions.
    "

    link https://my.jira/epic/12

    include *
  }

}
```


### Scoped views

View may be defined for some element (`view of ..`).  
View inherits the [scope](../references#scope) of the element:

```likec4
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```

This view becomes the default view for the element:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    include *
  }

  view {
    // on click navigates to 'view1', because it is the default view for 'cloud.backend'
    include cloud.backend
  }

}
```

You may have multiple views for the same element, but which one is default is not determined.

### View predicates

View predicates define what elements/relationships to include/exclude:

```likec4
// include element
include cloud.backend

// or exclude
exclude cloud.backend

// include children of cloud.backend and all the relationships
// among them and the elements of the view
include cloud.backend.*

// all incoming relationships
// if any found - includes cloud.backend and source elements
include -> cloud.backend
include * -> cloud.backend

// all outgoing relationships
// if any found - includes cloud children and target elements
include cloud.* ->

// all relationships from customer to cloud children (direction is important)
// if any found - includes customer and targeted children
include customer -> cloud.*

// any relationships between cloud.backend and cloud.frontend (both directions)
include cloud.backend <-> cloud.frontend
// same as:
include
  cloud.backend -> cloud.frontend,
  cloud.frontend -> cloud.backend

// elements by kind
include element.kind = container
include element.kind != system

// elements by tag
include element.tag = #next
include element.tag != #V2
```

Wildcard may be used to reference "everything", but it depends on the context.

```likec4
view {
  // include all top level elements and their relationships
  include *
}

view of cloud.backend {
  // include 'cloud.backend', its children and all the incomings/outgoings
  include *
}
```

<Aside>
  Order is significant, and predicates are applied as defined in view.  
  `exclude` applies only to elements/relationships included before.
</Aside>

Example:

```likec4
view of bigbank {
  // rules are merged
  include
    customer,
    bigbank,
    customer -> bigbank.*

  // exclude all children of bigbank
  exclude bigbank.*

  // but include webApplication
  include bigbank.webApplication
}
```

<Aside type='tip'>
  Try to move predicates to see how it affects the view.
</Aside>


### Custom navigation

It is possible to define custom navigation and links between views:

```likec4

view view2 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // navigate to 'view3' on click
    navigateTo view3
  }
}

view view3 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // the same element, but navigate back to 'view2'
    navigateTo view2
  }
}
```

### Override elements

It is possible to override element properties just for the view:

```likec4
view {
  // Include the element and override its properties
  include cloud.backend with {
    title 'Backend components'
    description '...'
    technology 'Java, Spring'
    color amber
    shape browser
  }
}
```

### Style rules

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  
Example from [BigBank](/examples/bigbank/components/):

```likec4
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to apiApplication and its descendants
  style apiApplication, apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }

  // apply only to the tagged elements
  style element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }
}
```

<Aside>
  [Overrides](#override-elements) have higher priority than style rules.
</Aside>

### Extend views

Views can be extended to avoid duplication, create a "baseline" or, for example, "slides" for a presentation:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 {
    include *
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    title 'Same as View1, but with more details'

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    include some.backend
  }

  // cascade inheritance
  view view3 extends view2 {
    title 'Same as View2, but with more details'

    include * -> some.backend
  }

}
```

The predicates and style rules of extended views are merged with the ones from ancestors.

Extended views also inherit the scope:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```
