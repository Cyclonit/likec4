LikeC4 is a DSL for describing software architecture. It might look like [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), though it is not
fully compatible.

The source files must have `.likec4` or `.c4` extensions.  
LikeC4 looks for all source files and merges them into _a single model_ (explained later in [Workspace](./workspace)).

A project may look like this:

<FileTree>
- backend
  - service1
    - model.c4
    - views.c4
  - service2
    - model.c4
  - ...
- externals
  - amazon.c4
  - ...
- landscape.c4
- specs.c4
</FileTree>



## Top-level statements

Source files should have at least one of these statements:

- `specification` - defines element kinds to be used in the model, like **app**, **microservice**, **grapqlMutation**...
- `model` - architecture elements, hierarchies, compositions and relationships
- `views` - visualizations of the architecture

```likec4
specification {
  //...
}

model {
  //...  
}

views {
  //...
}
```

It is not allowed to have multiple statements of the same kind.  

```likec4
model {
}

// ⛔️ not allowed to have multiple statements
model {}
```

But it is allowed to skip any of them, so you can have only `model` or only `views` or only `specification` or any combination of them.
