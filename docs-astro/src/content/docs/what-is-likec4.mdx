title: What is LikeC4?
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

LikeC4 is a language, a DSL, that describes architecture as a single model and then compiled into multiple diagrams, from different perspectives and details.  

You have a _**single source of truth - your code**_.  
Any change, refinement or deprecation in the model is reflected automatically,
keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

### Why "like"?

<Aside>
  If you never heard about _C4 Model_, check the [website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.
</Aside>

LikeC4 inherits the simplicity of C4, but allows you to use your _own notation_, _your element types_ and any number of nested levels and detalization.  

Also, LikeC4 is a _**toolchain**_ that provides:

- architecture-as-a-code with native IDE support
- development server with live reload
- static website generation ([live demo](https://template.likec4.dev/view/cloud))
- interactive and customizable React diagrams _in-the-box_
- CI/CD automation via CLI and GitHub Actions
- export to various formats:
  - PNG
  - Mermaid
  - D2
  - DOT (Graphviz)

You can use LikeC4 as a standalone tool or integrate it into your existing toolchain.

### What does LikeC4 look like?

```likec4 filename="example.c4"
specification {
  // Element kinds used in our architecture
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person
    }
  }
  element system
  element component
  // Relationship kind
  relationship async
}

// Describe the architecture
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Customer of Cloud System'
  }
  
  cloud = system 'Cloud System' {  

    backend = component 'Backend' {
      description 'Backend services and API'
    }

    ui = component 'Frontend' {
      description '
        All the frontend applications
        of Cloud System
      '
      style {
        shape browser
      }      
    }    
  }

  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'  

  // Relationship of predefined kind
  ui -[async]-> backend 'requests via GraphQL'
}

// What diagrams to generate
views {
  view of cloud {
    include *

    style * {
      color muted
    }   
    style cloud.* {
      color green
    }
  }
}

```
