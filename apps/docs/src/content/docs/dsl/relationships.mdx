import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Relationships describe the connections, data flows and interactions of the elements,  
and created with the **`->`** operator:

```likec4
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  cloud = service 'Cloud'

  customer -> cloud
}
```

#### Relationship kinds

Relationships can be "kinded":

```likec4
specification {
  element system
  // Define relationship kind
  relationship async
  relationship uses
}

model {
  system1 = system 'System 1'
  system2 = system 'System 2'

  system1 -[async]-> system2

  // Or prefix with '.' to use the kind
  system1 .uses system2
}
```

This allows us to express and add more semantics to the interactions between the elements, for instance, from a technology perspective (REST, GRPC, GraphQL, Sync/Async, etc.) or from a business perspective (delegation, inform, accountability, etc.).  
It's up to you to define the relationship kinds that make sense for your context.

<Aside type='tip'>
  The relationship kinds allow to customize the styling of the relationships, see [styling](/dsl/styling#relationship)
</Aside>

#### Relationship definition

Relationships may be nested

```likec4
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend
    customer -> frontend
  }
}
```

Nested relationships may be _"sourceless"_, then the source is the parent element

```likec4
specification {
  relationship graphql
}
model {
  customer = actor {
    // same as customer -> frontend
    -> frontend 'opens in browser' 
  }
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend {
      // same as frontend -[graphql]-> backend
      -[graphql]-> backend 'requests data'  
    }
  }
}
```

Or use `it` or `this` to refer to the source element:

```likec4
model {
  customer = actor {
    it -> frontend 'opens in browser'
    this -> frontend 'opens in browser'
  }
}
```

:::caution

_"sourceless"_ relationships must be nested:

```likec4
model {  
  -> backend // ⛔️ Error: model can't be a source
}
```

#### Relationship Properties

##### Title

Relationships may have a title (and better to have one):

```likec4 {7-8, 12}
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    // Title can be inlined
    frontend -> backend 'requests data to display'
  }

  customer -> frontend {
    title 'opens in browser' // or nested
  }
}
```

##### Description

```likec4
model {
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    description 'Customer opens the frontend in the browser to interact with the system'
  }
}
```

:::caution

Description is not displayed in the diagrams yet  
In progress

:::

##### Technology

```likec4
model {
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    technology 'HTTPS'
  }

  // Or in a shorter way
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' 'HTTPS'
}
```

##### Metadata

Same as [elements metadata](/dsl/model/#element-metadata):

```likec4
model {
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    metadata {
      prop1 'value1'
      prop2 'value2'
    }
  }
}
```

##### Tags

Relationships may be tagged

```likec4
model {
  // inlined
  frontend -> backend 'requests data' #graphql #team1

  // or nested
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    #graphql #team1 
  }
}
```

##### Links

Relationships may have multiple links:

```likec4 copy
model {
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    // External link
    link https://any-external-link.com

    // or any URI
    link ssh://bastion.internal 'SSH'

    // or relative link to navigate to sources
    link ../src/index.ts#L1-L10
  }
}
```
