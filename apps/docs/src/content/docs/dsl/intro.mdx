LikeC4 is a DSL for describing software architecture.

Source files must have `.likec4` or `.c4` extensions.  
All sources merged into _a single model_ (explained later in [Workspace](/dsl/workspace)).

A project may look like this:

<FileTree>
- backend
  - service1
    - model.c4
    - views.c4
  - service2
    - model.c4
  - ...
- externals
  - amazon.c4
  - ...
- landscape.c4
- specs.c4
</FileTree>

## Top-level statements

Source file should have at least one of these statements:

- `specification` - defines element kinds to be used in the model, like **app**, **microservice**, **graphqlMutation**...
- `model` - architecture elements, hierarchies, compositions and relationships
- `views` - visualizations

```likec4
// example.c4
specification {
  //...
}

model {
  //...  
}

views {
  //...
}
```

It is not allowed to have multiple statements of the same kind: 

```likec4 del="model {}"
// invalid.c4
model {
}

// ⛔️ not allowed to have multiple statements
model {}
```

But it is allowed to skip any of them, so only `model`, or only `views`, or only `specification`, or any combination of them.
