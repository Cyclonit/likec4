### What is LikeC4?

LikeC4 is a set of tools and DSL, that describes architecture as a single model and then compiled into multiple diagrams.  

Your code is _**single source of truth**_.  
Any change, refinement or deprecation is reflected automatically in the architecture diagrams.  
No more outdated documentation!  
And history of changes is your version control system.

LikeC4 provides:

- architecture-as-a-code with native IDE support
- development server with live reload
- static website generation (<a href="https://template.likec4.dev/view/cloud" target='_blank'>live demo</a>)
- React and Webcomponents generation to embed to your website
- CI/CD automation via CLI and GitHub Actions
- export to various formats:
  - PNG
  - Mermaid
  - D2
  - DOT (Graphviz)

You can use LikeC4 standalone or integrate with existing toolchain.

### Why "like"?

LikeC4 is inspired by the C4 model and Structurizr DSL, and goes beyond them by offering flexibility and customization.   
You can _**use your ubiquitous language**_, your terms and any number of nested levels.  

If you never heard about _C4 Model_, check the <a href="https://c4model.com/" target='_blank'>website</a>.


### What does LikeC4 look like?

```likec4
specification { // define "types" of architecture elements
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person // how to render
    }
  }
  element system
  element component
  relationship async // allow "typed" relationship
}

model { // single source of truth
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
  cloud = system 'Our SaaS' {
    backend = component 'Backend' {
      icon tech:graphql
      description 'Implements business logic and provides GraphQL API'
    }

    ui = component 'Frontend' {
      description 'NextJS application'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }

    ui -[async]-> backend 'requests via HTTPS'
  }
}

views {
  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'
    include *, cloud.*

    style cloud.* {
      color green
    }
  }
}
```

Run CLI to preview: 

```bash
likec4 start
```
