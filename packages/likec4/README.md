## Install

> **Compatibility Note:**  
> LikeC4 requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18+, 20+

### Local installation

If you're using it in an npm project, install it as a development dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev likec4
```

You can reference it directly in the `package.json#scripts` object:

```json5
{
  scripts: {
    dev: 'likec4 serve ...',
    build: 'likec4 build ...'
  }
}
```

> Check out the template repository [likec4/template](https://github.com/likec4/template)
> with pre-configured CI for building and deploying to github pages.

To use the binary, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) while in the project directory:

```sh
npx likec4 ...
```

### Global installation

If you want to use it in any arbitrary project without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh
npm install --global likec4
```

Then, you can call `likec4` directly:

```sh
likec4 ...
```

## Usage

### Preview diagrams

In a folder with LikeC4 sources:

```sh
likec4 serve
```

This will recursively search for `*.c4`, `*.likec4` files and serve them in a local web server.

Any changes to the sources will trigger a live-update of diagrams.

Refer to the help for more options:

```sh
likec4 serve --help
```

### Build static website

```sh
likec4 build -o ./dist
```

The output folder will contain a static website (single-page application).
