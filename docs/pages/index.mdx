<IndexPageSection title="What is C4 Model?">  
The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about C4 - check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.

<IndexPageSection title={'What is LikeC4? Why "like"?'}>    
  C4 is great. But sometimes we need to go futher suggested levels and even have custom ones with our semantics.  
  This is where LikeC4 comes in. It allows to customize and tailor architecture model to our needs.  
  Customization is essential for Architecture-as-a-Code approach.

<IndexPageSection title={'What does LikeC4 look like?'}>   

  LikeC4 is a modeling language and tooling to generate diagrams from the model.  
  Example ([full source on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/develop/docs/likec4/index-page/index-page.c4)):

  ```likec4 filename="example.c4"
  // custom elements for the model
  specification {
    element actor
    element system
  }

  // describes architecture as single model
  model {
    customer = actor 'Customer' {
      description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    }

    saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
      description 'Our product allows customers to manage their data'
    }

    customer -> saas 'uses to manage data'
  }

  // generares diagrams from the model 
  views {
    view index {
      include *
    }
  }
  ```  

  Run CLI to generate react components (or export to any other format):

  ```bash
  likec4 codegen react -o likec4-generated.tsx
  ```

  Import component:

  ```jsx
  import { LikeC4View } from "$/likec4-generated"

  // ...

  <LikeC4View viewId="index"/>
  ```

  And this is what we get (click to explore):
