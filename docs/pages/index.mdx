<IndexPageSection title={'What is LikeC4? Why "like"?'}>  
  LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture, and tools to generate diagrams from the model.  

  LikeC4 is inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/), but provides some flexibility.
  You can define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in your architecture model.
  This allows you to create a perfectly tailored system design.

  LikeC4 source ([full source on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/develop/docs/likec4/index-page/index-page.c4)):

  ```likec4 filename="example.c4"
  // customise model
  specification {
    element actor {
      style {
        shape person
      }
    }
    element system
  }

  // describe architecture
  model {
    customer = actor 'Customer' {
      description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    }

    saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
      description 'Our product allows customers to manage their data'
    }

    customer -> saas 'uses to manage data'
  }

  // generate diagrams
  views {
    view index {
      include *
    }
  }
  ```  

  CLI to generate react components (or export to other format):

  ```bash
  likec4 codegen react -o likec4-generated.tsx
  ```

  Website:

  ```jsx
  import { LikeC4View } from "$/likec4-generated"

  // ...

  <LikeC4View viewId="index"/>
  ```

  And this is rendered (click to explore):
