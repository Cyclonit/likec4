<IndexPageSection title={'What is LikeC4? Why "like"?'}>    
  LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture, and tools to generate diagrams from the model.  
  Inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but with some flexibility.

You define your own notation, custom element types and any number of nested levels in the architecture model.  
 Perfectly tailored to your needs.
