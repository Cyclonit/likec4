<IndexPageSection title="What is C4 Model?">  
The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about C4 - check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.

<IndexPageSection title={'What is LikeC4? Why "like"?'}>    
  C4 is great. But sometimes we need to go futher suggested levels and even have custom ones with our semantics.  
  This is where LikeC4 comes in.

  LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture. It might look like [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), though it is not
  fully compatible.

  With LikeC4 you have more flexibility, you can define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in your architecture model.  
  This allows you to create a system design that is tailored to your specific needs and requirements.

<IndexPageSection title={'What does LikeC4 look like?'}>   

  LikeC4 is a modeling language and tooling to generate diagrams from the model.  
  Example ([full source on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/develop/docs/likec4/index-page/index-page.c4)):

  ```likec4 filename="example.c4"
  // customise model
  specification {
    element actor {
      style {
        shape person
      }
    }
    element system
  }

  // describe architecture
  model {
    customer = actor 'Customer' {
      description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    }

    saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
      description 'Our product allows customers to manage their data'
    }

    customer -> saas 'uses to manage data'
  }

  // generate diagrams
  views {
    view index {
      include *
    }
  }
  ```  

  CLI to generate react components (or export to any other format):

  ```bash
  likec4 codegen react -o likec4-generated.tsx
  ```

  Import component:

  ```jsx
  import { LikeC4View } from "$/likec4-generated"

  // ...

  <LikeC4View viewId="index"/>
  ```

  And this is what we get (click to explore):
