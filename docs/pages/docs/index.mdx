# Getting Started

LikeC4 inherits the ideas of [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/).

Based on "software architecture as code" approach, it allows to define architecture model in a text file and automaticallty generate various views from it.  
That means you can keep your architecture model in the repository, review changes, track history and compare generated views.

The three pillars:

- `specification` - you are free to go beyond C4 layers and define your own element kinds, like **app**, **microservice**, **grapqlMutation**, wantever you need
- `model` - architecture elements, hierarchies, compositions and relationships
- `views` - visual "projections" of the model from different perspectives and detalization levels

Any change in the model automatically reflected - rename elements, update descriptions, mark as deprecated or add/remove relationships -  and all views are updated automatically.

<Steps>

### Tailor your model

We start with defining the element kinds we want in our model.  
For now we need only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define first elements

Start with top-level architecture elements

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {7-8} filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add nested elements

Assume our system has two main components - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add new kind to the specification and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Add relationships

We have at least these relationships:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,17-18} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}
```

### Landscape view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).  
Let's add the Landscape view, i.e bird's eye view of the architecture.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {23-25} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index { 
    include *
  }

}
```

We got this:

![landscape view](/getting-started/01.png)

<Callout type="info">
  **Why there is a relationship?**

  The relationships are implied from the nested elements.  
  `customer` has the relationship with the nested `saas.ui` element
</Callout>

### Add more views

View may have a root element `view of ...` as initial scope.  
Then predicate `include *` is applied to the root element and includes nested elements.  
This covered in more details in [LikeC4 Language - Views](/docs/dsl/views).

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {29-31} filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *
  }  

}
```

Imagine, we zoom in the `saas` element, see nested elements and their relationships:

![saas view](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,45-47} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }  

}
```

The `saas` view after changes:

![saas view after changes](/getting-started/03.png)

### Change model

Let's change the description of the `customer` and the label of `customer -> ui`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,31} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Our dear customer'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'enjoys our product'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'
    
    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }  

}
```

We made changes and all views are updated automatically.

`index` view:

![landscape view after changes](/getting-started/04.png)

`saas` view:

![landscape view after changes](/getting-started/05.png)

</Steps>

## Next steps

The following steps would be - install the CLI, export views as images or generate react components.  
Or you can play with [this tutorial in playground](/playground/getting-started/).

But better start the language reference first and then jump to the playground.
