# Getting Started

Software systems evolve and architecture diagrams become outdated quite quickly, especially if managed manually.  

LikeC4 allows to describe architecture in a single model,
and generate multiple views with different detalization and perspectives.
Any change, any refinement, any deprecation in the model is automatically reflected, keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

## C4 Model

LikeC4 inherits the ideas of [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/).

<Steps>

### Tailor your model

We start with defining the element kinds we want in our model.  
For now we need only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define first elements

Start with top-level architecture elements

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {7-8} filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add nested elements

Assume our system has two main components - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add new kind to the specification and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Add relationships

We have at least these relationships:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,17-18} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}
```

### Landscape view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).  
Let's add the Landscape view, i.e bird's eye view of the architecture.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {23-25} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index { 
    include *
  }

}
```

We got this:

![landscape view](/getting-started/01.png)

<Callout type="info">
  **Why there is a relationship?**

  The relationships are implied from the nested elements.  
  `customer` has the relationship with the nested `saas.ui` element
</Callout>

### Add more views

View may have a root element `view of ...` as initial scope.  
Then predicate `include *` is applied to the root element and includes nested elements.  
This covered in more details in [LikeC4 Language - Views](/docs/dsl/views).

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {29-31} filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *
  }  

}
```

Imagine, we zoom in the `saas` element, see nested elements and their relationships:

![saas view](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,45-47} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }  

}
```

The `saas` view after changes:

![saas view after changes](/getting-started/03.png)

### Change model

Let's change the description of the `customer` and the label of `customer -> ui`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,31} copy filename="getting-started.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Our dear customer'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'enjoys our product'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'
    
    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }  

}
```

We made changes and all views are updated automatically.

`index` view:

`saas` view:
