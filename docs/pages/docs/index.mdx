# Getting Started

Software systems evolve and architecture diagrams become outdated quite quickly, especially if drawn manually.

## C4 Model

_C4 Model_ is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of software systems.  
It is developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
If you never heard about it, check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.

C4 provides a set of diagrams from a single model, that enables software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

LikeC4 inherits the simplicity of the C4 Model and in addition:

- allows you to define your own notation, element types and any number of nested levels inside your architecture model
- architecture-as-a-code with native IDE support
- interactive and customizable React diagrams _in-the-box_
- CI/CD automation
- import/export to various formats, ready to be used with any documentation tool

LikeC4 describes architecture as a single model and generates multiple architecture diagrams from different perspectives, like per use-case.
Any change, refinement or deprecation in the model is reflected automatically,
keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

## What does LikeC4 look like?

Better to follow the [tutorial](#tutorial) to get the idea, but if you are impatient and want to try:

- Online playgrounds:
  - [Blank](/playground/blank/)
  - [Tutorial](/playground/getting-started/)
  - [BigBank Architecture](/playground/)
- Online with [github.dev](https://github.dev/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4)
- Online with [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/github/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4)
- Install [official VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=likec4.likec4-vscode)

<Steps>

### Tailor specification

We start with defining the element kinds we use in our model.  
For now, we need only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define the first elements

Start with top-level architecture elements

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {7-8} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add nested elements

Assume our system has two main components - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add a new kind to the specification and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Add relationships

Relationships describe the connections and interactions of the elements.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,17-18} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}
```

### Landscape view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).  
Let's add the Landscape view, i.e. bird's eye view of the architecture.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {23-25} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    include *
  }

}
```

We got this:

![landscape view](/getting-started/01.png)

<Info>
**Why there is a relationship?**

The relationships are implied from the nested elements.  
- `customer` has a known relationship with the nested `saas.ui` element

that implies
- `customer` has _some_ relationship with `saas`.  

</Info>

### Add more views

A View may have a root element `view of ...` as the initial scope.  
Then predicate `include *` is applied to the root element and includes nested elements.  
This is covered in more detail in [LikeC4 Language - Views](/docs/dsl/views).

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {29-31} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *
  }

}
```

Imagine, we zoom in on the `saas` element, and see nested elements and their relationships:

![saas view](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add a label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,45-47} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

The `saas` view after changes:

![saas view after changes](/getting-started/03.png)

### Change model

Let's change the description of the `customer` and the label of `customer -> ui`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,31} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Our dear customer'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'enjoys our product'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

When we make changes, all views are updated automatically.

View `index`:

![landscape view after changes](/getting-started/04.png)

View `saas`:

![saas view after changes](/getting-started/05.png)

### Try it yourself

Play with [this tutorial in playground](/playground/getting-started/) and try to add the following:

- change [shape](/docs/dsl/styling/#shape) of the `customer` element
- add a database (with `storage` shape) and tables like `customers` and `orders` (what relationships should be added?)
- add an external system, like Stripe, and show how the backend might interact with it
