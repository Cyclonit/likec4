# Getting Started

The three pillars:

- `specification` - what can be defined in an architecture model
- `model` - architecture elements, hierarchy and relationships
- `views` - visual "projections" of the model from different perspectives

Any change in the model is reflected everywhere automatically.   
Rename elements, update descriptions, mark as deprecated or add/remove relationships -  and all views are updated automatically.

Various ways to play and learn the tool:
- Install [official VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=likec4.likec4-vscode)
- Online [playground](/playground/)
- With [github.dev](https://github.dev/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4) 
- With [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/github/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4) 

Be sure you agree and install the recommended extension if you pick last two options.


## Getting Started Example

<Steps>

### Tailor your model

We start with defining the kinds we want to use in our model.  
For now we want only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define base model

We work on a system and hope to have customers.

```likec4 showLineNumbers filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add system components

Assume the system has two main componets - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add new element kind - `component` and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11}  filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Relationships

We have at least these relationships in our architecture:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,16,17} filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}
```

### First view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).   

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {23-25} filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {    
    include *
  }

}
```

In this case we look at the whole model from the top.  
We got this:

![](/getting-started/01.png)

<Callout type="info">
  **Why there is a relationship?**

  The relationships are implied from the model, for example,
  `customer -> saas` is implied, because
  the `customer` has relationship with nested `saas.ui` element   
  
  But we can exclude by predicate:  
  `exclude * -> saas` - all the incoming to the `saas` relationships
</Callout>

You can copy the source and paste to the [playground](/playground/)

### Add more views

View may have a root element (`view of ...`) and it is used as initial scope/predicate

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {27-29} filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *
  }  

}
```

Imagine, we zoom-in and expand the `saas` element, look at nested elements and their relationships:

![](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich the model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,43-45} copy filename="demo.c4" 
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    include *
  }

  view of saas {    
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }  

}
```

The `saas` view now looks like this:

![](/getting-started/03.png)

And if we change any element/relationship - the change will be reflected everywhere.
