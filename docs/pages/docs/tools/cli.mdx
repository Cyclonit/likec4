# CLI

The `likec4` CLI is a tool for various operations and automation over LikeC4 projects, such as:

- Preview diagrams in a local web server (with fast hot-reload on changes)
- Build a static website for sharing and embedding diagrams
- Export to PNG, Mermaid, Dot, D2
- Generate Typescript with: 
  - React components
  - Structured data


## Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm install -D likec4
```

### Global installation

To use the CLI globally, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx):

```sh
npx likec4 [command]
```

If you want to use it in any arbitrary project without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --global likec4
```

Then, you can call `likec4` directly:

```sh
likec4 [command]
```

## Usage

Almost all commands have a `--help` option and provide usage examples.

```sh
likec4 build -h
likec4 codegen react -h
```

### Preview diagrams

In a folder with LikeC4 sources:

```sh
likec4 serve
# Aliases:
likec4 start
likec4 dev
```

This recursively searchs for `*.c4`, `*.likec4` files in current folder, parses and serves diagrams in a local web server.  
Any changes in the sources trigger a super-fast hot update and you see changes in the browser immediately.

> **Tip:**  
> You can use `likec4 serve [path]` in a separate terminal window and keep it running while you're editing diagrams in editor, or even serve multiple projects at once.

### Build static website

Example [https://template.likec4.dev](https://template.likec4.dev/view/cloud)  
Build a single-page application with all diagrams:

```sh
likec4 build -o ./dist
```

When you deploy the website, you can use "Share" button to get a link to a specific diagram.  

> **Tip:**  
> [likec4/template](https://github.com/likec4/template) repository demonstrates how to deploy to github pages.

There is also a supplementary command to preview the build:

```sh
likec4 preview -o ./dist
```

### Export to PNG

```sh
likec4 export png -o ./assets
```

This command starts temporary local web server and uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to take screenshots of diagrams.

### Export to Mermaid, Dot, D2

Export to various formats via codegen:

```sh
likec4 codegen mmd
likec4 codegen mermaid
likec4 codegen dot
likec4 codegen d2
```

### Generate React components

```sh
likec4 codegen react --outfile ./src/likec4.generated.tsx
```

> Output file should have `.tsx` extension  
> By default, it generates `likec4.generated.tsx` in current directory

### Generate structured data

```sh
likec4 codegen views-data --outfile ./src/likec4.generated.ts

#Aliases
likec4 codegen views ...
likec4 codegen ts ...
```

> Output file should have `.ts` extension  
> By default, it generates `likec4.generated.ts` in current directory
