# LikeC4 Language

LikeC4 is a DSL for describing software architecture.
It is a superset of the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), and is designed to be easy to read and write.

## Tailor your specification

  view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
      color secondary
    }

    style apiApplication, apiApplication.* {
      color primary
    }
  }

}
