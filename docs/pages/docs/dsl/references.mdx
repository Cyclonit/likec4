# References

LikeC4 uses the lexical scope, with hoisting, almost like in JavaScript.

## Scope

To understand references, we need to understand scopes first.  
Example:

```likec4 filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
}
```

Every element is unique in the model, so we can add relation referencing them, like:

```likec4 {6} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  frontend -> api
}
```

But if we add another `service2` with `api`:

```likec4 {6-8} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
}
```

The reference is ambiguous - now there are two `api` components in the model.

Every element creates a new scope inside `{...}`, so `api` is unique in the scope of `service1` and `service2`,
but not in the scope of `model`.

We can resolve this problem by moving the relation to the scope of `service2`:

```likec4 {9-11} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK,
                    //    'api' is unique in 'service2'
                    //    'frontend' is unique in 'model'
  }
}
```

## Hoisting

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  **Hoisting** is a mechanism that moves the reference to the top of the scope.
</Callout>

The element name is hoisted (_"bubbles"_) to the upper scope if it stays unique.  
We even may reference something that is not yet defined as it will be hoisted later.

The relation from `frontend` referencing not yet defined `graphql`:

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="hoisting.c4"
model {

  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK, references to 'api' from 'service1'
    frontend -> graphql // ✅ This is OK, references to unique 'graphql' defined later
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is ambiguous

  service service2 {
    component api
    component graphql

    frontend -> api  // ✅ This is OK, references to 'api' from 'service2'
  }

}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Line 7 and line 17 the same:  
  `frontend -> api`

But they refer different elements:  
 Line 7 refers to `service1.api`  
 Line 17 refers to `service2.api`

</Callout>

## Fully qualified names

Fully qualified name is a global name, a "unique path" to an element if we traverse it's parents.

Example:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {11,12} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
  frontend -> service1.api // ✅ This is OK
  frontend -> service2.api // ✅ This is OK
}
```

Or even:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {5} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend {
      -> service2.api
    }
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }
}
```

Middle-parts may be omitted, if target element is already unique in the scope:

```likec4 showLineNumbers filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service {
    component backend1  {
      component api
    }
    component backend2  {
      component api
      component graphql
    }
  }

  frontend -> service.backend1.api // ✅ Non-ambiguous fully qualified name

  frontend -> backend1.api  // ✅ This is OK, backend1 is unique in the scope of model
  frontend -> backend2.api  // ✅ This is also OK

  frontend -> service.api   // ⛔️ Error: api is ambiguous in the scope of service

  frontend -> service.graphql // ✅ This is also OK
                              //    we omit backend2 as
                              //    graphql is unique in the scope of service
}
```
