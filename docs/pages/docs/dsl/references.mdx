# References

LikeC4 uses the lexical scope, with hoisting, almost like in JavaScript.

## Scope

Lets consider the following example:

```likec4 filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
}
```

Every element is unique in the model, so we can add relation referencing them, like:

```likec4 {6} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  frontend -> api
}
```

But if we add another `service` with `api`:

```likec4 {6-9} filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }
  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
}
```

The reference is ambiguous - now there are two `api` components in the model.   
Every block creates a new scope, so `api` is unique in the scope of `service1` and `service2`, but not in the scope of `model`.  

We can fix it by moving the relation to the scope of `service1`:

```likec4 {6} filename="references.c4" 
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK, api is unique in the scope of service1
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }  
  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
}
```

## Hoisting

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Hoisting** is a mechanism that moves the reference to the top of the scope.
</Callout>

The element name is hoisted (_"bubbles"_) to the upper scope while it stays unique.  
We even may reference something that is not yet defined as it will be hoisted later.

The relation from `frontend` referencing not yet defined `graphql`:

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="hoisting.c4"
model {
  
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK, references to api from service1
    frontend -> graphql // ✅ This is OK, references to unique graphql defined later
  }  

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is ambiguous

  service service2 {
    component api
    component graphql

    frontend -> api  // ✅ This is OK, references to api from service2
  }  
  
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Line 7 and 17 look the same  
  `frontend -> api`  

  But they refer different `api` elements.
</Callout>

## Full qualified names

Full qualified name is a unique "path" to the element, including all the parents.

Example:

```likec4 filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
  frontend -> service1.api // ✅ This is OK
  frontend -> service2.api // ✅ This is OK
}
```

Or even:

```likec4 filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend {
      -> service2.api 
    }
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }
}
```

Middle-parts may be omitted, if target element is already unique in the scope:

```likec4 filename="references.c4"
model {
  service service {
    component backend1  {
      component api
    }
    component backend2  {
      component api
      component graphql
    }  
  }

  frontend -> service.backend2.graphql // ✅ Non-ambiguous full qualified name

  frontend -> service.graphql // ✅ This is also OK
                              //    we omit backend2 as
                              //    graphql is unique in the scope of service

  frontend -> service.api // ⛔️ Error: api is ambiguous in the scope of service
}
```
