# Relations

## Relation Definition

Relations are used to describe the connections and/or interactions between elements.  
They are defined using the `->` operator.

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  cloud = service 'Cloud'

  customer -> cloud
}
```

Relation may be nested

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend
    customer -> frontend
  }
}
```


Relation may have a title (and better to have one)

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend 'requests data'
  }

  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser'
}
```

Nested relation may be "sourceless" or use `it` or `this` as source.  
Then the source is the parent element.


```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  customer = actor {
    -> frontend 'opens in browser'
  }
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend {
      -> backend 'requests data'
    }
  }

  // also valid to use 'it' or 'this'
  customer = actor {
    it -> frontend 'opens in browser'
    this -> frontend 'opens in browser'
  }    
}
```
