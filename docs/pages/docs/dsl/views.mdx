# Views

Views are the architecture diagrams, projections of the model from different perspectives, with different level of details, like:

- System / service overviews
- Components interactions in specific use case
- Data flows

## View Definition

View may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced).

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {
  // with name
  view index {  
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

View may have a title 

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view {
    title 'Titled View'
  }

}
```

View may have a root element (`view of ..`) and inherit its scope:

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'

    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```

## View predicates

View predicates define what elements/relations should be included/excluded.

```likec4 
// include element
include cloud.backend

// or exclude
exclude cloud.backend

// include children of cloud.backend
include cloud.backend.*

// all incoming relations
include -> cloud.backend

// all outgoing relations from cloud children
include cloud.* ->

// all relations from customer to cloud children
include customer -> cloud.*

// elements by kind
include element.kind = container
include element.kind != system

// elements by tag
include element.tag = #next
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Limitation**  
  Relations with container elements are not rendered, i.e. only among leaf elements.  
  Working on it...
</Callout>

Wildcard may be used to reference "everything", but depends on the context.

```likec4 
view {
  // include all top level elements and their relations
  include *
}

view of cloud.backend {
  // include 'cloud.backend', its children and all the incomings/outgoings
  // (relations with the rest of the architecture)
  include *
}
```

Predicates are applied in same the order as defined in view.  
`exclude` applies only to elements/relations included before.


```likec4 
view {
  // rules may be merged
  include
    customer,
    bigbank,
    customer -> bigbank.*

  // include all children of bigbank
  include bigbank.*  
  // but exclude webApplication
  exclude bigbank.webApplication
}
```


## Style rules

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  
Example from [BigBank](/examples/bigbank/components/):

```likec4 
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to apiApplication and its descdendants
  style apiApplication, apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }

  // apply only to tagged elements
  style element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }
}
```
