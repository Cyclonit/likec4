# Views

Views are the visualizations of the same model from different perspectives, with different level of details, like:

- System / service overviews, internal structure
- Interactions between components in the context of some use case
- Incoming and outgoing data flows

## View Definition

View may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced).

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {
  // with name
  view index {  
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

View may have a title 

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view {
    title 'Titled View'
  }

}
```

View may have a root element, then it inherits the scope (for references)

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'

    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```

## View predicates

View predicates define what elements/relations should be included/excluded.

```likec4 
// include element
include cloud.backend

// or exclude
exclude cloud.backend

// children of cloud.backend
include cloud.backend.*

// incoming relations
include -> cloud.backend

// outgoing relations
include cloud.* ->

// relations between
include customer -> cloud.*
```

Wildcard may be used to reference "everything", but depends on the context.

```likec4 
view {
  // include all top level elements
  include *
}

view of cloud.backend {
  // include root element and all its children
  include *
}
```

Predicates are applied in same the order as defined in view.  


```likec4 
view {
  // rules may be merged
  include
    customer,
    bigbank.*

  // exclude webApplication being included with `bigbank.*`
  exclude bigbank.webApplication

  include
    bigbank,
    customer -> bigbank.*
}
```

  Relations with container elements are not shown.
</Callout>


## Style rules

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  
Example from [BigBank](/examples/bigbank/components/):

```likec4 
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to apiApplication and its descdendants
  style apiApplication, apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }
}
```
