# Workspace

Workspace is a directory with LikeC4 source files. During the parsing, these files are "_merged_" into a single architecture model.  
You are free to organize the workspace as you want.

{/* TODO: Why no imports? */}

## Example

Assume we have the following workspace:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name='cloud' open>
    <FileTree.File name='service1.c4' />
    <FileTree.File name='service2.c4' />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name='externals' open>
    <FileTree.File name='amazon.c4' />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name='landscape.c4' />
  <FileTree.File name='specs.c4' />
</FileTree>

<Tabs items={['specs.c4', 'landscape.c4', 'amazon.c4']}>
  <Tab>
    This file defines only the specification.

    ```likec4
    specification {
      element actor {
        style {
          shape person
        }
      }
      element system
      element service
      element externals
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    This file describes only the top-level elements.

    ```likec4
    model {
      customer = actor 'Customer'
      cloud = system 'Cloud'

      customer -> cloud 'uses cloud services'
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    This file keeps the externals separately.

    ```likec4    
    model {
      amazon = externals 'Amazon Web Services' {
        rds = service 'Database'
      }
    }
    ```  
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Extend element

`extend` is a way to enrich and define nested elements in a separate file.

Below we define the `cloud.service1` separately, for instance, we don't want to mess up the `landscape.c4` file with the internals of the `cloud`.

```likec4 filename="cloud / service1.c4"
model {
  extend cloud {
    service1 = service 'Service 1'
  }
}
```

The target element (or better say _parent_) must be referenced by a fully qualified name.

```likec4
model {
  extend rds        // ⛔️ Error: rds not found in the global scope
  extend amazon.rds // ✅ Resolved by fully qualified name
}
```

The element extension inherits the scope of the parent. 
Here is what inside `service2.c4` file:

```likec4 filename="cloud / service2.c4"
model {

  // extend cloud again
  extend cloud {
    // define service2
    service2 = service 'Some Service 2' {

      -> service1 'delegates some work' // ✅ service1 is known inside cloud
                                        //    even defined in another file
    }
  }

  service2 -> service1       // ⛔️ Error: service1 not found inside 'service2.c4'

  service2 -> cloud.service1 // ✅ but resolved by fully qualified name
}
```
