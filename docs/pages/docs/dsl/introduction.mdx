# LikeC4 Language Introduction

LikeC4 is a DSL for describing software architecture.  

It might look like [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), though it is not
fully compatible.

LikeC4 removes boundaries and gives more expressive freedom to the user,
makes it easier to write with IDE support and exports to other formats
or even generates React components to embed and explore the architecture.  
[Check example](/examples/bigbank/landscape/) 

The source files should have `.likec4` or `.c4` extension.  
LikeC4 looks for all source files and **merges into a single model**, use are free to organize your files as you wish:

Example:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="backend" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="service1" open>
      <FileTree.File name="model.c4" />
      <FileTree.File name="views.c4" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="service2" open>
      <FileTree.File name="model.c4" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="externals" open>
    <FileTree.File name="amazon.c4" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="landscape.c4" />
  <FileTree.File name="specs.c4" />  
</FileTree>

## Top level statements

- `specification` - define your own element kinds, like **app**, **microservice**, **grapqlMutation**, wantever you need
- `model` - architecture elements, hierarchies, compositions and relationships
- `views` - visual "projections" of the model from different perspectives (by predicates)


```likec4
specification {
  //...
}

model {
  //...  
}

views {
  //...
}
```

It is not allowed to change the order or have multiple statements of the same kind.  

```likec4
model {
}

// ⛔️ not allowed to have multiple statements
model {}
```

But it is allowed to skip any of them, so you can have only `model` or only `views` or only `specification` or any combination of them.
