import { LikeC4View } from "$/components"

# Personal Banking Customer

LikeC4 has no view types to limit us, we can define a view from the customer perspective, to show the systems they interact with.

```likec4
views {

  view customer of customer {
    include
      customer,
      bigbank,
      internetBankingSystem,
      customer -> internetBankingSystem.*,
      customer -> bigbank.*
    
    exclude webApplication
  }

}
```

```jsx
import { LikeC4View } from "$/components"

// ...

<LikeC4View viewId="customer"/>
```

<LikeC4View viewId="customer"/>
