import { LikeC4View } from "$/components"

# Personal Banking Customer

LikeC4 has no view types limiting us.

We can define a view from the customer perspective to explain interactions with the system.

```likec4
views {

  view customer of customer {
    include
      customer,
      bigbank,
      internetBankingSystem,
      customer -> internetBankingSystem.*,
      customer -> bigbank.*
    
    exclude webApplication
  }

}
```

Result:

<LikeC4View viewId="customer"/>
