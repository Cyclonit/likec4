# Personal Banking Customer

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The original model does not have customer views.
</Callout>

LikeC4 has no view types and limits on it.  
We can define a view from the customer perspective to explain interactions with the system.

```likec4
views {

  view customer of customer {
    include
      *,
      customer -> internetBankingSystem.*,
      customer -> bigbank.*
    exclude webApplication
  }

}
```

Result:

<LikeC4View viewId="customer"/>
