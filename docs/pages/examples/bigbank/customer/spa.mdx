# Customer: Web application

We can define a view to explain interactions with web application.

```likec4
views {

  view spa of singlePageApplication {
    include
      *,
      apiApplication,
      internetBankingSystem,
      -> singlePageApplication ->

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    style singlePageApplication, customer {
      color primary
    }
  }

}
```


<LikeC4View viewId="spa"/>
