# LikeC4 Code

Define specification with element kinds.  

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/_spec.c4 filename="_spec.c4" 
```


Now, copy-paste the model and views from Structurizr DSL.  
LikeC4 does not support the deployment views, so skip them.  
`views` also require some additional work, that is covered in the next sections.  

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/bigbank.c4 filename="bigbank.c4" showLineNumbers
```
