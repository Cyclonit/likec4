# LikeC4 Code

This is the model defined with LikeC4.

Start with specification and element kinds.  

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/_spec.c4 filename="_spec.c4" 
```

Copy-paste model and views sections from Structurizr DSL.  
LikeC4 does not support the deployment views at the moment, so skip them.  

`views` section requires some additional work, that is covered in the next sections:

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/bigbank.c4 filename="bigbank.c4" showLineNumbers
```

You can open this example in playground:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Open in playground" href={`/playground/`} arrow/>
</Cards>

Or start with [System Landscape](./landscape) diagram.
